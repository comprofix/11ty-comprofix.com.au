After many months, we finally have a new website that works. 

In the past, previous websites were built using Wordpress. Because I could go many months without creating a blog post, the website would get "forgotten". Because of this, the versions of Wordpress and plugins that were being used at the time would sometimes become "compromised", thus allowing attackers to gain entry to server and deface website etc.

So a new website back end was needed. After investigating and trying many different styles, I settled on using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev){target="_blank"}.

Eleventy is a framework for building static websites. Once I built the code and templates. The website was born. All using pure HTML pages.

I will start rebuilding my old blog posts. As well as create some new and awesome content for you all to enjoy.
